# QA Engineer Test Cases and Bug Reports

Hello, I'm Mikhail Lazko, a Software QA Engineer. This repository shows examples of my test cases and bug reports to demonstrate my approach to creating clear and understandable test documentation.

## Project Assumptions and Documentation Approach

1. The test cases and bug reports are based on the [Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) platform.
2. It is assumed that all team members are familiar with the project URL, so it is not explicitly included in the test cases or bug reports to avoid redundancy.
3. To ensure security and maintain document clarity, login credentials are not embedded in the test cases or bug reports. Instead, they are stored in a separate file (`Credentials.json`). This approach also reduces unnecessary repetition in the documents.
4. I have deliberately focused on the key attributes in both test cases (ID, title, steps, expected results) and bug reports (ID, summary, steps to reproduce, actual results, expected results, attachments) because these attributes are crucial for clear communication.

## Repository Contents

- **Test Cases:**
  - Includes three sample test cases that cover different testing scenarios (positive, negative) and testing levels (smoke, critical path, extended).

- **Bug Reports:**
  - Features three bug reports covering a range of issues. Each bug report is clear, easy to follow, and includes visual attachments for better understanding of both the actual and expected results.

- **Credentials File**
  - Contains the login credentials (`Credentials.json`) used in documentation.

- **Attachments**
  - Files referenced in test cases and bug reports for additional context.
